# Learning-Projects
This repository stores projects that I learn as I go.

**No License** is needed for this; This is a very open book for people who are curious about how I learned and use it to improve later quality projects.


**Everyone starts at something. Why not share your progress?**

Notebook I use:
* *Google Colab*

Libraries I'm learning:
* *Pytorch*
